abstract: "We report a highly sensitive NEMS DC/low frequency magnetic field sensor consisting of an AlN/FeGaB resonator, with a $Î”$E effect-based sensing principle. Unlike previously reported magnetic field detection schemes, such as observing induced magnetoelectric voltage, or monitoring impedance, we designed a system to directly measure the reflected output voltage from the sensor as a function of magnetic field. The AlN/FeGaB resonator shows a resonance frequency shift of 3.19 MHz (1.44%), which leads to a high DC magnetic field sensitivity of 2.8 Hz/nT and a limit of detection of 800pT in an unshielded, room temperature and pressure, lab environment."
