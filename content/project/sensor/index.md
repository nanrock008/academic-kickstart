Compact magnetometers show potential to detect neuronal activity that could advance the brain-machine interface technology. We have developed a new class of miniaturized magnetometers by using the MEMS nano-plate resonators loaded with magnetic thin films. By the detection of frequency shifts in these devices, we were able to approach a magnetic field detection limit of a few hundreds pico-Tesla. We have also interfaced the MEMS magnetometer with a low power CMOS oscillator for integrated MEMS-CMOS systems with the direct frequency readout.
