abstract: "Strong magnetoelectric coupling was demonstrated in magnetic/ antiferroelectric heterostructures of FeGaB/Pb(La,Sn,Zr,Ti)O3, which exhibited a voltage induced coercive field change of 7-10 Oe and ferromagnetic resonance field shifts by ∼80 Oe. Nonvolatile voltage induced magnetization switching and ferromagnetic resonance field shift in FeGaB were realized based on the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase transition in Pb(La,Sn,Zr,Ti)O 3. The nonvolatile strong voltage control of magnetism in magnetic/antiferroelectric heterostructures has great implications in compact and power efficient spintronics and RF/microwave components. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC."
