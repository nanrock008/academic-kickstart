abstract: "Strong converse magnetoelectric coupling was observed in a multiferroic heterostructure of Fe59.3Co28.0Hf12.7 film on (011) cut lead zinc niobate-lead titanate (PZN-PT) slab, which exhibited a large electric field (E-field) tunability of microwave magnetic properties. With the increase of E-field from 0 to 6 kV/cm on PZN-PT, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field Hr shifts downwards by 430.7 Oe along [011̄] direction and upwards by 492.9 Oe along [100] direction of the PZN-PT. Accordingly, the strong magnetoelectric coupling led to a significantly enhanced self-biased FMR frequency from 4.2 to 7.9 GHz under zero bias magnetic field, and the magnetic damping constant $α$ was decreased from 0.0260 to 0.0185 at the same time. These features demonstrate that this multiferroic laminate is promising in fabrication of E-field tunable microwave components. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC."
