Motivated by the CMOS scaling limits, we aim to develop new functional devices and beyond-CMOS systems by harnessing **good vibrations** and the **spin of electrons** in solids for communication, memory and sensory applications.

Our [research](#projects) spans from MEMS and spintronics devices, that are powered by advanced materials, to circuits and architectures that enable these devices.
