abstract: "This paper reports on the first demonstration of an ultra-miniaturized, high frequency (215 MHz) and high sensitivity MEMS resonant magnetic field sensor based on an AlN/FeGaB bilayer nano-plate resonator capable of detecting magnetic field at nano-Tesla level. Despite of the reduced volume and the high operating frequency of the sensor, high electromechanical performances were achieved (quality factor Q ≈ 511 and electromechanical coupling coefficient kt2 ≈ 1.63%). This first prototype was characterized for different magnetic field levels from 0 to 152 Oe showing a frequency sensitivity of ∼ 1 Hz/nT and a limit of detection of ∼ 10 nT. © 2013 IEEE."
