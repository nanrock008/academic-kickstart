abstract: "We report on voltage impulse induced reversible bistable magnetization switching in FeGaB/lead zirconate titanate (PZT) multiferroic heterostructures at room temperature. This was realized through strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling between ferroelectric PZT and ferromagnetic FeGaB layer. Two reversible and stable voltage-impulse induced mechanical strain states were obtained in the PZT by applying an electric field impulse with its amplitude smaller than the electric coercive field, which led to reversible voltage impulse induced bistable magnetization switching. These voltage impulse induced bistable magnetization switching in multiferroic heterostructures provides a promising approach to power efficient bistable magnetization switching that is crucial for information storage.
