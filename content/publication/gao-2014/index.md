abstract: "We report new high quality factor (Q) integrated GHz magnetic inductors based on solenoid structures with FeGaB/ $backslash$rm Al-2$backslash$rm O-3 multilayer films, which show significantly enhanced inductance and quality factor at GHz frequencies over their air core counterparts. These inductors show an excellent high-frequency performance with a wide operation frequency range 0.5-2.5 GHz, in which the inductance is flat and the peak quality factor can reach $backslash$sim$backslash$rm 20. The inductance of the magnetic inductor shows textgreater100$backslash$% enhancement compared with that of the same size air core inductor. These novel GHz inductors with high inductance and Q enhancement show great promise for applications in radio frequency integrated circuits. Â© 1963-2012 IEEE."
