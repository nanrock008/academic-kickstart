abstract: "Barium titanate (BTO) thin films were deposited on polycrystalline Ni foils by using the polymer assisted deposition (PAD) technique. The growth conditions including ambient and annealing temperatures were carefully optimized based on thermal dynamic analysis to control the oxidation processing and interdiffusion. Crystal structures, surface morphologies, and dielectric performance were examined and compared for BTO thin films annealed under different temperatures. Correlations between the fabrication conditions, microstructures, and dielectric properties were discussed. BTO thin films fabricated under the optimized conditions show good crystalline structure and promising dielectric properties with ∈ r ∼ 400 and tan $δ$ textless 0.025 at 100 kHz. The data demonstrate that BTO films grown on polycrystalline Ni substrates by PAD are promising in device applications. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd."
