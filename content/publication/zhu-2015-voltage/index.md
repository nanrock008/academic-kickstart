abstract: "An energy efficient approach is demonstrated to remarkably shift the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field by applying an electric field to various spinel ferriteferroelectric multiferroic heterostructures prepared by the low temperature spin-spray technique. The electric field-induced magnetic anisotropy changes, as well as the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient, were quantitatively determined in all multiferroic heterostructures. The broadness of FMR linewidth upon applying an electric field indicates that inhomogeneous ME coupling takes place, which arises from the ferrroelastic domain switching and polarization elongation. These results provide a framework for realizing compact, light-weight, and ultralow power electronics and microwave devices."
