abstract: "A Fe0.7Co0.3-B multilayer was laminated by three Fe0.7Co0.3-B ferromagnetic sublayers prepared by composition gradient sputtering. Three Fe0.7Co0.3-B ferromagnetic sublayers have their individual directions of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and the easy magnetic axis of neighboring sublayer successively rotates 60°in the film plane. It is exciting that a quasi magnetic isotropy was achieved in the designed multilayer with a quasi-isotropic hysteresis loop and quasi-isotorpic ferromagnetic resonance around 3.7GHz. This omnidirectional multilayer is promising for the application in inductors since the 100% hard-axis excitation is achieved for any shaped inductors. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC."
