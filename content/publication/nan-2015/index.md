abstract: "We experimentally investigate spin-orbit torques and spin pumping in NiFe/Pt bilayers with direct and interrupted interfaces. The dampinglike and fieldlike torques are simultaneously measured with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance tuned by a dc-bias current, whereas spin pumping is measured electrically through the inverse spin-Hall effect using a microwave cavity. Insertion of an atomically thin Cu dusting layer at the interface reduces the dampinglike torque, fieldlike torque, and spin pumping by nearly the same factor of â‰ˆ1.4. This finding confirms that the observed spin-orbit torques predominantly arise from diffusive transport of spin current generated by the spin-Hall effect. We also find that spin-current scattering at the NiFe/Pt interface contributes to additional enhancement in magnetization damping that is distinct from spin pumping."
