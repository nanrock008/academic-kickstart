abstract: "This work report new integrated high quality factor (Q) GHz magnetic transformers based on solenoid structures with FeGaB/Al2O3 multilayer films. These transformers show excellent high-frequency performance with a wide operation frequency range of 0.5-5GHz, in which primary, secondary, and mutual inductances are flat, and the peak quality factor can reach around 14 at frequency of 1.2 GHz. High mutual coupling and low insertion loss are also demonstrated. These novel GHz transformers with high Q and mutual coupling show great promise for applications in radio frequency integrated circuits. Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC."
