Current-induced spin-orbit torque enables highly efficient manipulation of magnetization for spintronic applications. To efficiently and deterministically drive, for example, perpendicularly-magnetized devices that are preferred for high-density memories, an out-of-plane anti-damping torque is required. However, symmetry conditions generally restrict anti-damping torque to lie in the sample plane. We have demonstrated a strategy to achieve unconventional spin-orbit torques, based on long-range non-collinear magnetic order within the bulk of the spin-source layer. These spin torques correspond to out-of-plane and Dresselhaus-like spin polarizations which are forbidden in any sample with two-fold rotational symmetry. This approach could enable high efficient manipulation of magnetization for antiferromagnetic spintronics.
