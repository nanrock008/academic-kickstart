abstract: "Dual E- and H-field control of microwave performance with enhanced ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) tunability has been demonstrated in microwave composites FeGaB/PZN-PT(011). A voltage-impulse-induced non-volatile magnetization switching was also realized in this work, resulting from the hysteretic type of phase transition in PZN-PT(011) at high electric fields. The results provide a framework for developing lightweight, energy efficient, voltage-tunable RF/microwave devices."
