abstract = {Rare-earth pyrochlore iridates (RE2Ir2O7) consist of two interpenetrating cation sublattices, the RE with highly frustrated magnetic moments, and the iridium with extended conduction orbitals significantly mixed by spin-orbit interactions. The coexistence and coupling of these two sublattices create a landscape for discovery and manipulation of quantum phenomena such as the topological Hall effect, massless conduction bands, and quantum criticality. Thin films allow extended control of the material system via symmetry-lowering effects such as strain. While bulk Pr2Ir2O7 shows a spontaneous hysteretic Hall effect below 1.5 K, we observe the effect at elevated temperatures up to 15 K in epitaxial thin films on (111) yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates synthesized via solid-phase epitaxy. Similar to the bulk, the lack of observable long-range magnetic order in the thin films points to a topological origin. We use synchrotron-based element-specific x-ray diffraction and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism to compare powders and thin films to attribute the spontaneous Hall effect in the films to localization of the Ir moments. We link the thin-film Ir local moments to lattice distortions absent in the bulklike powders. We conclude that the elevated-Temperature spontaneous Hall effect is caused by the topological effect originating either from the Ir or Pr sublattice, with interaction strength enhanced by the Ir local moments. This spontaneous Hall effect with weak net moment highlights the effect of vanishingly small lattice distortions as a means to discover topological phenomena in metallic frustrated magnetic materials.},

abstract = {Magnetization dynamics induced by spin–orbit torques in a heavy-metal/ferromagnet can potentially be used to design low-power spintronics and logic devices. Recent computations have suggested that a strain-mediated spin–orbit torque (SOT) switching in magnetoelectric (ME) heterostructures is fast, energy-efficient, and permits a deterministic 180° magnetization switching. However, its experimental realization has remained elusive. Here, the coexistence of the strain-mediated ME coupling and the SOT in a CoFeB/Pt/ferroelectric hybrid structure is shown experimentally. The voltage-induced strain only slightly modifies the efficiency of SOT generation, but it gives rise to an effective magnetic anisotropy and rotates the magnetic easy axis which eliminates the incubation delay in current-induced magnetization switching. The phase field simulations show that the electric-field-induced effective magnetic anisotropy field can reduce the switching time approximately by a factor of three for SOT in-plane magnetization switching. It is anticipated that such strain-mediated ME-SOT hybrid structures may enable field-free, ultrafast magnetization switching.},

abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the interaction between the electron spin and the orbital angular momentum, can unlock rich phenomena at interfaces, in particular interconverting spin and charge currents. Conventional heavy metals have been extensively explored due to their strong SOC of conduction electrons. However, spin-orbit effects in classes of materials such as epitaxial 5d-electron transition-metal complex oxides, which also host strong SOC, remain largely unreported. In addition to strong SOC, these complex oxides can also provide the additional tuning knob of epitaxy to control the electronic structure and the engineering of spin-to-charge conversion by crystalline symmetry. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature generation of spin-orbit torque on a ferromagnet with extremely high efficiency via the spin-Hall effect in epitaxial metastable perovskite SrIrO3. We first predict a large intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity in orthorhombic bulk SrIrO3 arising from the Berry curvature in the electronic band structure. By manipulating the intricate interplay between SOC and crystalline symmetry, we control the spin-Hall torque ratio by engineering the tilt of the corner-sharing oxygen octahedra in perovskite SrIrO3 through epitaxial strain. This allows the presence of an anisotropic spin-Hall effect due to a characteristic structural anisotropy in SrIrO3 with orthorhombic symmetry. Our experimental findings demonstrate the heteroepitaxial symmetry design approach to engineer spin-orbit effects. We therefore anticipate that these epitaxial 5d transition-metal oxide thin films can be an ideal building block for low-power spintronics.},

Tactile sensors based on various one-dimensional materials have been widely explored. However, precise control of the direction and distribution of these nanomaterials remains a great challenge, and it has been difficult to scale down the device. Here, we introduce highly sensitive integrated flexible tactile sensors based on uniform phase-change Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) thin films that can scale device size down, at least, to micrometer range. Significant piezoresistive effect has been observed in GST-based sensors, showing a giant gauge factor of 338. A proof of concept 5 × 5 sensor array functioning as a touch panel has been demonstrated. Also, the flexible GST tactile sensor has been utilized for monitoring of radial artery pulse. In addition to the well-known tunable electrical and optical properties, the piezoresistive GST films provide a versatile platform for the integration of sensing, recording, and displaying functions. By reducing feature size to one micron, flexible tactile sensors with high spatial resolution and sensitivity are demonstrated. A collaborative team led by Nian-Xiang Sun from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University developed integrated flexible tactile sensors and sensor arrays with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The sensor's high sensitivity (e.g. gauge factor of 338) is due to developed piezoresistive Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films. To obtain a high spatial resolution above 12,700 pixels per inch, the sensor's feature size was reduced to one micron. Sun and co-workers demonstrate the applicability of the integrated flexible tactile sensors for next-generation touch display applications through proof-of-concept 5 × 5 sensor arrays and Ge2Sb2Te5 strain sensors with enhanced performance at smaller size.},

However, the AMR effect of metal materials is relatively weak with an AMR ratio below 2{\%}, which results in low voltage output. In order to improve the sensitivity of weak magnetic fields, we optimize the structure of the AMR sensor with a specific photolithographic process. We use two different designs of Hall bar and Wheatstone bridge with similar barber pole structures, and investigate the angular dependence as well as magnetic field dependence of AMR ratio and voltage output. With Wheatstone bridge, the magnetoresistance leads to a voltage output without dc components. The NiFe magnetic layer and the Au electrode are patterned into a highly conductive barber poles structure, and a high voltage output ratio of about 80{\%} is obtained. At the same time, we achieve a high sensitivity of about 4.3 Oe-1, which implies potential applications in AMR effect-based magnetic field sensors.},

The bulk acoustic waves in ME antennas stimulate magnetization oscillations of the ferromagnetic thin film, which results in the radiation of electromagnetic waves.

In this study, we demonstrate electrical flipping of magnetization between the out-of-plane and the in-plane directions in (Co/Pt)3/(011) Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 multiferroic heterostructures through a voltage-controllable spin reorientation transition (SRT). The SRT onset temperature can be dramatically suppressed at least 200 K by applying an electric field, accompanied by a giant electric-field-induced effective magnetic anisotropy field ($\Delta$Heff) up to 1100 Oe at 100 K. In comparison with conventional strain-mediated magnetoelastic coupling that provides a $\Delta$Heff of only 110 Oe, that enormous effective field is mainly related to the interface effect of electric field modification of spin-orbit coupling from Co/Pt interfacial hybridization via strain. Moreover, electric field control of SRT is also achieved at room temperature, resulting in a $\Delta$Heff of nearly 550 Oe. In addition, ferroelastically nonvolatile switching of PMA has been demonstrated in this system. E-field control of PMA and SRT in multiferroic heterostructures not only provides a platform to study strain effect and interfacial effect on magnetic anisotropy of the ultrathin ferromagnetic films but also enables the realization of power efficient PMA magnetoelectric and spintronic devices.},

However, it is hard to achieve E-field regulation of PMA in conventional multiferroic laminates since the voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy is relatively small. In this study, we demonstrate E-field control of PMA in (Co/Pt)3/Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 multiferroic heterostructures at room temperature using ferromagnetic resonance measurement (FMR) and a magnetic optical Kerr (MOKE) microscope. When a single Co layer (tCo)=1.0 nm PMA is obtained, a resonance shift up to 470 Oe is obtained with a 12-kV cm-1 E field. Up to 75{\%} perpendicular magnetic moments can be controlled with an applied 10-kV cm-1 electric field at tCo=0.9 nm while little effect is obtained at tCo=0.7 nm. In addition, a multiferroic heterostructure with in-plane anisotropy is also studied at tCo=1.4 nm, and the resonance shifts are comparable to 1.0 nm. We relate this phenomenon to the instability of Co orbital moments near the critical transition area (0.9, 1.0, 1.4 nm). However, if tCo is far from the transition point, the magnetic properties become insensitive to an external stimulus (0.7 nm). This voltage manipulation of PMA in ultrathin Co films should offer possibilities for realizing electronic devices and memories with great energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Magnetoelectric effect, arising from the interfacial coupling between magnetic and electrical order parameters, has recently emerged as a robust means to electrically manipulate the magnetic properties in multiferroic heterostructures. Challenge remains as finding an energy efficient way to modify the distinct magnetic states in a reliable, reversible, and non-volatile manner. Here we report ferroelectric switching of ferromagnetic resonance in multiferroic bilayers consisting of ultrathin ferromagnetic NiFe and ferroelectric Pb 0.92 La 0.08 Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 O 3 (PLZT) films, where the magnetic anisotropy of NiFe can be electrically modified by low voltages. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements confirm that the interfacial charge-mediated magnetoelectric effect is dominant in NiFe/PLZT heterostructures. Non-volatile modification of ferromagnetic resonance field is demonstrated by applying voltage pulses. The ferroelectric switching of magnetic anisotropy exhibits extensive applications in energy-efficient electronic devices such as magnetoelectric random access memories, magnetic field sensors, and tunable radio frequency (RF)/microwave devices.},

However, one remaining issue of ferromagnetic/ferroelectric magnetoelectric bilayer composite is that the induced effective anisotropy disappears with the removal of the electric field. The introducing of the shape memory alloys may prevent such problem by taking the advantage of its shape memory effect. Additionally, the shape memory alloy can also "store" the magnetoelectric coupling before heat release, which introduces more functionality to the system. In this paper, we study a FeGaB/NiTi/PMN-PT multiferroic heterostructure, which can be operating in different states with electric field and temperature manipulation.

abstract = {Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials with adjacent dipoles oriented in antiparallel directions have a double polarization hysteresis loops. An electric field (E-field)-induced AFE-ferroelectric (FE) phase transition takes place in such materials, leading to a large lattice strain and energy change. The high dielectric constant and the distinct phase transition in AFE materials provide great opportunities for the realization of energy storage devices like super-capacitors and energy conversion devices such as AFE MEMS applications. Lots of work has been done in this field since 60-70 s. Recently, the strain tuning of the spin, charge and orbital orderings and their interactions in complex oxides and multiferroic heterostructures have received great attention. In these systems, a single control parameter of lattice strain is used to control lattice-spin, lattice-phonon, and lattice-charge interactions and tailor properties or create a transition between distinct magnetic/electronic phases. Due to the large strain/stress arising from the phase transition, AFE materials are great candidates for integrating with ferromagnetic (FM) materials to realize in situ manipulation of magnetism and lattice-ordered parameters by voltage. In this paper, we introduce the AFE material and it's applications shortly and then review the recent progress in AFEs based on multiferroic heterostructures. These new multiferroic materials could pave a new way towards next generation light, compact, fast and energy efficient voltage tunable RF/microwave, spintronic and memory devices promising approaches to in situ manipulation of lattice-coupled order parameters is to grow epitaxial oxide films on FE/ferroelastic substrates.},

abstract = {We experimentally investigate spin-orbit torques and spin pumping in NiFe/Pt bilayers with direct and interrupted interfaces. The dampinglike and fieldlike torques are simultaneously measured with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance tuned by a dc-bias current, whereas spin pumping is measured electrically through the inverse spin-Hall effect using a microwave cavity. Insertion of an atomically thin Cu dusting layer at the interface reduces the dampinglike torque, fieldlike torque, and spin pumping by nearly the same factor of ≈1.4. This finding confirms that the observed spin-orbit torques predominantly arise from diffusive transport of spin current generated by the spin-Hall effect. We also find that spin-current scattering at the NiFe/Pt interface contributes to additional enhancement in magnetization damping that is distinct from spin pumping.},

With the increase of electric field from 0 to 8 kV/cm on PZN-PT, the anisotropy field, HK, of the Co2FeAl film along [100] direction of PZN-PT is dramatically enhanced from 65 to 570 Oe due to the strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling between ferromagnetic Co2FeAl film and ferroelectric substrate.

It is however challenging to observe the combined strain charge mediated magnetoelectric coupling, and difficult in quantitatively distinguish these two magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms. We demonstrated in this work, the quantification of the coexistence of strain and surface charge mediated magnetoelectric coupling on ultra-thin Ni0.79Fe0.21/PMN-PT interface by using a Ni0.79Fe0.21/Cu/PMN-PT heterostructure with only strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling as a control. The NiFe/PMN-PT heterostructure exhibited a high voltage induced effective magnetic field change of 375 Oe enhanced by the surface charge at the PMN-PT interface. Without the enhancement of the charge-mediated magnetoelectric effect by inserting a Cu layer at the PMN-PT interface, the electric field modification of effective magnetic field was 202 Oe. By distinguishing the magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms, a pure surface charge modification of magnetism shows a strong correlation to polarization of PMN-PT.

Modification of ferromagnetic resonance is observed as a function of small DC current in sub-mm-wide strips of bilayers, consisting of magnetically soft FeGaB and strong spin-Hall metal Ta. From the detected current-induced linewidth change, we obtain an effective spin Hall angle of 0.08-0.09 independent of the magnetic layer thickness. Our results demonstrate that a sensitive resonance spectrometer can be a general tool to investigate spin Hall effects in various material systems, even those with vanishingly low conductivity and magnetoresistance.},

Compared with an identically sized patch antenna with dielectric material Rogers TMM13i ($\mu$r=1, $\epsilon$r=12) operating at 1120 MHz, the magnetic antenna on the Co2Z substrate exhibited a high bandwidth of 23{\%} at 360 MHz, which is much higher than 0.95{\%} for the nonmagnetic antenna on the TMM13i substrate. In addition, the resonance frequency of the patch antenna on Co2Z can be tuned from 360 MHz to ∼900 MHz, or a tunability of 2.5/1, via the bias magnetic field.

abstract = {Multiferroic composites with combined ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) phases have attracted extensive attention due to their strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling at room temperature [1-4]. Specifically in magnetic-piezoelectric heterostructures, the voltage applied to the piezoelectric layer produces a mechanical deformation that couples to the magnetic layer, and thus induces a change in the magnetic anisotropy and a shift in the resonance field for the ferromagnet. Large voltage-induced effective ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field has been demonstrated in multifer-roic composites such as YIG/PZT, FeGaB/PZNPT, Ni2MnGa/PMNPT, etc [5-7]. Unlike conventional devices where the Oersted fields generated by large electric current are used for FMR tuning, the voltage tuning is more power efficient as the bias voltage applied on piezoelectrics involves minimal electric current. Therefore, these magnetic-piezoelectric heterostructures show great potential for the next-generation of compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient RF/microwave devices.},

In such a VOx/PMN-PT heterostructure, the unique two-step electric polarization switching covers up to 90{\%} of the entire poled area and contributes to a homogeneous in-plane anisotropic biaxial strain, which, in turn, enables the lattice changes and results in the suppression of metal-insulator transition in the mechanically coupled VOx films by 6 K with a resistance change up to 40{\%} over a broad range of temperature. These findings provide a framework for realizing in situ and non-volatile tuning of strain-sensitive order parameters in strongly correlated materials, and demonstrate great potentials in delivering reconfigurable, compactable, and energy-efficient electronic devices.},

Increase in Al concentration from 0 to 2 {\%} further reduced the resistivity of the ZnO films by 3 orders of magnitudes from 3.4 × 10 4 to 14 $\Omega$ cm; while the Hall mobility increases from 1 to 140 cm2/V s at the same time. The optical photoluminescence measurement of Al-doped ZnO thin films in ultra violet (UV) was also demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The antiresonance and resonance frequencies have close but different values under identical bias conditions.

abstract = {Fe50Co50-Hf films were deposited on the (011)-cut single crystal lead zinc niobate-lead titanate (PZN-PT) substrates by a composition gradient sputtering (CGS) method. Strong converse magnetoelectric (ME) coupling was observed in the multiferroic laminates of CGS Fe 50Co50-Hf/PZN-PT, which exhibited a large electric field (E-field) tunability of microwave magnetic properties. With the increase of E-field strength from 0 to 8 kV/cm, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) fields Hr shifted upwards by 270.2 Oe and downwards by 237.7 Oe along hard axis and easy axis directions, being equivalent to 33.8 and 29.7 Oe cm/kV, respectively. Accordingly, the self-biased ferromagnetic resonance frequency fFMR significantly enhanced from 4.0 to 6.5 GHz with an increment of $\Delta$fFMR 2.5 GHz under a zero-bias magnetic field, and the magnetic damping constant $\alpha$ decreases from 0.0280 to 0.0185. The strong ME coupling between CGS Fe50Co50-Hf film and PZN-PT substrate not only enhanced the fFMR but also reduced the magnetic loss at microwave frequencies, which gives great opportunity in fabrication of tunable microwave devices. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

It is critical to pretreat nickel foils with hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) solution to form thin nickel oxide layers on the surfaces for the growth of BTO films. Both the concentration of H 2O 2 solution and the pretreated time were found to strongly affect the dielectric constant of BTO films, which may be associated with the oxygen diffusion from nickel oxide buffer layers to BTO layers during annealing.

Phys. Lett., 92 (2008) 092501]. An ultra high magnetic anisotropy field over 500 Oe and ferromagnetic frequency over 7 GHz were obtained in as-deposited FeCoHf films by CGS method due to the stress-induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. However, the magnetic properties of the CGS samples are non-uniform, showing a location dependence. In this paper, a modified CGS (MCGS) method was proposed to improve the original CGS method. It is revealed that the MCGS method dramatically improves the uniformity of the high-frequency soft magnetic properties of the as-deposited Fe 70Co 30 - B films. A narrow ferromagnetic resonance frequency (f FMR) range around 5.5 GHz (5.2-5.7 GHz) with a deviation less than 10{\%} and high uniaxial magnetic anisotropy field up to 330 Oe were obtained for as-deposited films with 75 mm in length. As Comparison, the f FMR of the CGS samples is very inhomogeneous and distribute in a broad range from 3.1 to 6.7 GHz with a large deviation as high as 116{\%}.
