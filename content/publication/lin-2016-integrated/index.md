abstract: "The coexistence of electric polarization and magnetization in multiferroic materials provides great opportunities for realizing magnetoelectric (ME) coupling, including electric field control of magnetism, or vice versa, through a strain-mediated ME coupling in layered magnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructures. Strong ME coupling has been the enabling factor for different multiferroic devices, which, however, has been elusive, particularly at RF/microwave frequencies. In this paper, most recent progress on new integrated multiferroic devices for sensing RF and microwave electronics will be presented, including novel RF Nano-electro-mechanical systems ME resonators with picotesla sensitivity for dc magnetic fields and novel gigahertz magnetic and multiferroic integrated inductors with a wide operation frequency range of 0.3∼3 GHz, a high quality factor close to 20, and a voltage tunable inductance of 50%∼150 %. At the same time, we will also demonstrate other tunable RF devices, including integrated non-reciprocal tunable bandpass filter with ultrawideband isolation more than 13 dB. These novel magnetics and multiferroic devices show great promise for applications, such as compact, lightweight, and power-efficient sensing, memory, RF, and microwave integrated electronics."
